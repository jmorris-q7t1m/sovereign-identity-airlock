# Sovereign Identity Airlock Framework

An enterprise-grade, algorithm-agnostic, token-based identity isolation and verification framework. This repository provides a stateless, two-container architecture designed to completely eliminate identity leakage (such as PII or cleartext emails) across down-stack enterprise microservice topologies.

This framework is distributed under the **Apache License 2.0**.

## Architectural Philosophy

Traditional enterprise authentication frameworks leak state. When microservices handle tokens containing raw, unhashed user identifiers (e.g., standard JWT claims), every single service boundary becomes a potential point of failure for identity disclosure.

The **Sovereign Identity Airlock Framework** solves this problem by enforcing a strict, deterministic, two-part microservice boundary:

1. **The Token Generator Engine (Ingress Gate):** Ingests raw identity parameters, cryptographically encapsulates them into an ephemeral, stateless token with a hard-coded 5.5-minute lifespan, and dispatches an out-of-band access ticket to the user.
2. **The Token Validator Engine (Perimeter Airlock):** Incepts the token, cryptographically verifies the signatures, and immediately processes the identity claims through a deterministic, non-reversible mathematical folding interface (`SovereignIdentityAirlock`). Downstream application logic never handles raw identifiers; they only receive a highly secure, anonymized topological handle (`folded_id`).

### Deterministic Linear Execution

To preserve strict state windows and prevent memory race conditions during cryptographic transformation, both microservices are engineered to run under a **single-worker, single-thread (`--threads 1`) Gunicorn configuration**.

This repository is built for highly scalable cloud architectures. Horizontal scaling should be handled at the **container orchestration layer** (e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS ECS Fargate) with maximum container instance concurrency set to `1`. This guarantees absolute linear isolation for every discrete authentication execution.

## Core Interface: `SovereignIdentityAirlock`

The validator incorporates an inline interface blueprint called `SovereignIdentityAirlock`. It exposes a `.fold()` method signature designed to accept a string and return an anonymized identifier:

```python
class SovereignIdentityAirlock:
    def __init__(self, sovereign_string: str):
        self._secret_seed = sovereign_string.encode('utf-8')

    def fold(self, identity_raw: str) -> str:
        # Standard default: Secure symmetric HMAC-SHA256
        hashed = hmac.new(self._secret_seed, identity_raw.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
        return f"v_id_{hashed[:32]}"

```

### Algorithm-Agnostic Extension

While the default implementation relies on strong symmetric hashing, the framework's interface contract is entirely algorithm-agnostic. Organizations deploying into quantum-threat environments can swap out the inner logic of the `.fold()` method to inject specialized **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** solutions—such as lattice-based ciphers or advanced asymmetric tokenization matrices—without changing a single line of the network or routing logic.

## Environment Configuration

Both containers are entirely stateless and depend on runtime configuration injected via environment variables.

### Generator Environment Variables

* `UI_DOMAIN_URL`: The base URL destination for your client application interface.
* `VAULT_SIGNING_KEY`: The secure secret key used to sign the outgoing token's `HS256` signature.
* `SENDER_EMAIL`: The source email address executing the notification dispatch.
* `SENDER_PASSWORD`: The secure credential or app-specific token authorizing SMTP mail relay.
* `SMTP_SERVER`: (Optional) Defaults to `smtp.gmail.com`.
* `SMTP_PORT`: (Optional) Defaults to `587`.

### Validator Environment Variables

* `VAULT_SIGNING_KEY`: The matching secret key used to decrypt and verify the inbound token signature.
* `SOVEREIGN_CONTEXT_STRING`: The cryptographic salt or seed injected into the Airlock class to execute unique topological transformations.

## Quickstart Deployment

To spin up either service container locally or within a staging environment, navigate to the respective directory and utilize standard Docker instructions:

### 1. Build the Container

```bash
docker build -t sovereign-generator ./generator

```

### 2. Run the Container

```bash
docker run -e PORT=8080 \
           -e UI_DOMAIN_URL="https://example.com" \
           -e VAULT_SIGNING_KEY="your-high-entropy-secret-key" \
           -e SENDER_EMAIL="auth@example.com" \
           -e SENDER_PASSWORD="your-secure-smtp-password" \
           -p 8080:8080 sovereign-generator

```
